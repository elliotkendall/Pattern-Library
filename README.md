# Emory Libraries Pattern Library

This pattern library is built using [Pattern Lab 2 Standard Edition for Mustache](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php). It contains the source folder for Pattern Lab which includes the mustache files, Sass files and CSS (dependent on Bourbon and Neat), and styles for the pattern lab itself.
## Installation
In the command line at the project root, enter `npm install` to install node dependencies.
## Generating the pattern library and setting to it to a watch state.
Enter `grunt`.
