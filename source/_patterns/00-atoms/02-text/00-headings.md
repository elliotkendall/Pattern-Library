Headings are ranked by the number given in their element name. In practice, headings should be used in rank order to outline the major and minor sections within a web document.

Use `{{> atoms-heading (level: <level>, text: <text>) }}` to include headings in other patterns, or `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>` to create headings.
