Optionally, buttons can contain icons. When using an icon button, the `.icon` class and any other icon style modifiers are placed directly on the button itself, and the nested icon should also be given a `.icon` class in order to identify the icon element. Use `{> atoms-button{:<styleModifier>}(icon: '<iconID>'{, ...}) }` to include an icon button within another pattern.
