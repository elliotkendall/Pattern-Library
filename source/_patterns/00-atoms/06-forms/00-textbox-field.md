This sample textbox uses `input[type="text"]`, but textboxes can come in a variety of flavors. Some other common textbox types include:

- `[type="date"]`
- `[type="email"]`
- `[type="number"]`
- `[type="password"]`
- `[type="search"]`
- `[type="tel"]`
- `[type="time"]`
- `[type="url"]`

While `[type="text"]` is the defaul and most common, other, more specific textbox types may be more appropriate in a given context. Note, when using these certain input types, the browser performs a preliminary check on the data but subsequent forms of data validation should always be used.
