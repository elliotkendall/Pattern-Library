Dropdowns provide users with a list of options to choose from. A dropdown menu is created by using a single `select` element to wrap one or more `option` elements. Dropdown menu options can also be grouped together by nesting one or more options within an `optgroup`, disabled by adding the `disabled` Boolean attribute to an option, and/or selected using the `selected` attribute on the option.
