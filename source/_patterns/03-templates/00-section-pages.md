title: Section Pages
---

Section pages introduce sections of the site by displaying the contents of that section and the contents of any subsections. This can be a useful way of giving guided context to the user about what the section is about and what they can find within. The lead paragraphs and meaningful sublinks are critical to the utility of this page type. A tiled variation of the section page is also avaiable, which serves much the same purpose but with a tiled layout.
