These fonts are for web use only and should not be used in print. The preview of the font is given for clarity along with some additional information, including but not limited to:

- FAMILY

  The corresponding CSS font-family value.

- SASS

  The Sass value of the font. This value uses a Sass @function to retrieve the given font by name from the $fonts map. The proper syntax for this Sass @function is `font('<name>')`.
