Use class="alert" for styling content as a default alert.

Below are a list of alternative alert styles along with example use cases for which they should be considered:

* .alert-success (successful form submission)
* .alert-info (non-emergency informational notices)
* .alert-danger, .alert-error (errors, warning notices, confirmation of potentially irrecoverable actions)
