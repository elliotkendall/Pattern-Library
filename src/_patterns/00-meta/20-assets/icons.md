## Getting Started

These are the official icons used by Emory Libraries.

###### EXPORT VIA GRUNT

```


### Description

Our icon library consists of icons pulled from various icon sets. At preset, these icon sets include [Google's Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=outline) and [Socicons](http://www.socicon.com/). Use this icon library as a guide when building patterns that incorporate icons.
