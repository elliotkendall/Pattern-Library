## Getting Started

The research help directory page is intended to provide users with an overview of all research help available to them.

###### EXPORT VIA GRUNT

```
grunt export:templates-research-help-directory
```


### Description

The research help directory template can be used to create a Research Help Directory page.


### Best Practices

- Only ever include one main section within the template
- Only one research help directory page should exist within a site


## Schema

This pattern extends [`organisms-main`][organisms-main] and uses the schemas for [`molecules-card-library-aid`][molecules-card-library-aid] and [`compounds-cards`][compounds-cards].

[organisms-main]: /patterns/50-organisms-main-main/50-organisms-main-main.html
[molecules-card-library-aid]: /patterns/30-molecules-cards-card-library-aid/30-molecules-cards-card-library-aid.html
[compounds-cards]: /patterns/40-compounds-cards-cards/40-compounds-cards-cards.html
